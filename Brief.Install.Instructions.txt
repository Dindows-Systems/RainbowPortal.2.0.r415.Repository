1) Create a virtual directory called whatever you want, and point it at your downloaded dev\websites\rainbow\ folder.
2) Create a database called whatever you want or skip this if you already have one.
(By alpha 4 or 5 we will provide msde, so this will be optional)
3) correct the connection string in web.config, there is one in connectionStrings section, and one in yafnet section.
4) point browser to localhost/whatever you called site.

To work on solution, open visual studio and open web site from IIS.

If you are a developer, you can open the Rainbow.sln which will open all the core code projects.
