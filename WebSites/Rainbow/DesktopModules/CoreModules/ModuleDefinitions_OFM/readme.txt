ModuleDefinitions_OFM - Part of the OneFileModuleKit

OFM = OneFileModule

With this module you install modules based on the OneFileModuleKit. First you must
copy your file to the server and then you can install it using this module.
NOTE: This module have no file editing or file creation functionality. You can use
Notepad to edit your OneFileModule file and use FileManager to move the file (or FTP).

With this module you do not need to install OneFileModule based modules with 
the 'Admin - Database Tool' module (and the typical sql from a DBPatch.sql file).
