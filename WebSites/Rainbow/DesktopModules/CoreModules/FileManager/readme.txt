HISTORY
Ver. 1.0 - 14 Nov 2004 - Implemented by: Rob Siera based on free code at http://www.seekdotnet.com/freeware.aspx
8 april 2005 - Added to CVS


ISSUES AND KNOWN PROBLEMS:
--------------------------
- Not localized yet
- Module Property "Downloadable extentions" not fully implemented (should accept a comma-delimited list - now only accepts one extention which is quite useless)
- Still some hardcoded HTML. Should all be replaced with css from theme (including widths', heights', colors, etc ..)

I will give all the support needed to a volunteer who wants to improve this module it.

Already done:
- it's already a rainbow module.
- installer works
- doesn't use the database
- shows dirs/files that are children of a supplied directory

What needs to be done:
- make it use theme css styles
- make it multi-lingual
- implement Downloadable extentions (This defines a comma-delimited list of extentions that you can download On Click - if not provides then it is view only) (now only one extention is supported)
- review the On Click mechanism. I think it would be better to implement links there instead of postback (as is implemented now).  This postback makes the it irritating to use the Back button triggering the 'form: send again message'.

As you see, only little issues left.
I hope someone can take up this little task.
